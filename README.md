# mastery-tracker

The tracker for champions mastery in League of Legends.

Important note
--------------
I have not registered this site as a product in the Riot Developer Portal, so I cannot host this site directly using my API key. Because of that, you have to retrieve your own API key from [Riot Developer Portal](https://developer.riotgames.com/) if you want to use this site.
Then you need to create file .env file with line below:
```
API_KEY="(your API key)"
```
The development API key expires after 24 hours and has to be regenerated to use the site again.
