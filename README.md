# mastery-tracker

The tracker for champions mastery in League of Legends.

  

Important note
--------------
I had not registered this site as a product in the Riot Developer Portal, so I cannot host this site directly using my API key. Because of that, you have to retrieve your own API key from [Riot Developer Portal](https://developer.riotgames.com/) if you want to use this site.
Then you need to create file key.php with line below:
><?php $key ="(your API key)"; ?>
I did not add this file to repository because of risk of accidental sending the key to GitHub which could be problematical.
The development API key expires after 24 hours and has to be regenerated to use the site again.
